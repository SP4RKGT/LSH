# LSH
# ONLY FOR LINUX
LSH is an extremely light shell written completely in c++ for embedded systems

Installation(option 1):
Clone this repo with "git clone https://github.com/SP4RKGT/LSH"
run *clang++ -Os -o main main.cpp*
You will now have a file called "main"

Installation(option 2):
Go to lshdownload.duckdns.org and click the download button

Optional:
If you want you can move it to /usr/bin/lsh with *install -Dm755 main /usr/bin/lsh*

Troubleshooting:
You need to have clang and git installed for this, so go and install those.
